# Standardizing Terms for Electronic Resource Management

## Introduction

Awhile ago now,
I conducted some historical research
on a librarian named Ralph Parker.
Inspired by technological advances in automation,
specifically the use of the punched cards and machines,
Parker began to apply this technology
to library circulation processes in the 1930s and
thus became the first person to automate part of the
library's work flow.
By the mid-1960s,
Parker's decades long pursuit of library automation
led to some major advances,
including the founding of [OCLC][oclc].
Meanwhile, the punched card system he continued to
develop eventually led to massive increases
in circulation and better service to patrons.
In the mid-60s he wrote the following about
the installation and launch of a new punched card system
to help automate circulation:

> To the delight of the patrons it requires only four
> seconds to check out materials (as cited in Burns, 2014).

I think about that quote often.
When I read that in his annual report in the archives
at the University of Missouri,
I could feel his giddiness with these results.
Until this achievement,
when a patron borrowed an item from the library,
the process involved completing multiple forms
in order to be sure that accurate records were kept.
Accurate record keeping is important.
Libraries need to protect their collections but
also provide access to them.
As stated in the [Flexner (1927)][flexner1927]:

> circulating books in several ways. It [the library] must

> considerations combine to make it necessary for the [

> which are commonly known as routines (p. 6).

What were those routines in the 1930s and thenabouts?
Why was Parker so excited about his system taking
only four seconds to check out a work?
Well, two routines are important for circulation.
The first involves membership and the
second involves charging or checking out works.

### Membership

First, if the patron was not yet a member of a library,
then they had to register to become one;
hence, the first routine was to check their membership and
register them as borrowers if they were not yet a member
or if their membership had expired.
If this was a public library,
then the process might vary a bit depending if
the member was an adult or a youth
(or *juveniles* in the lingo of the time).
Regardless, this routine basically involved completing
an application card, creating a member record and
filing that away for the library's use, and
then giving the borrower a card of their own,
i.e., their **borrower's card**.

### Charging

Once membership status was confirmed or created,
then the circulation librarian employed a system
to **charge** books to the borrower.
Several systems had been employed up through the late 1920s,
including the **ledger system**,
the **dummy system**,
the **temporary slip system**,
the **permanent slip or card system**,
the **Browne system**, and
eventually the [Newark charging system][newark]
(see [Flexner, 1927, pp. 73-82 for details][flexner1927]).
Assuming the librarian in the 1930s used
the Newark system,
when a book was to be checked out,
the librarian needed to enter the details on a
"book card, a date slip and a book pocket for each book"
(Flexner, 1927, p. 78).
Flexner goes on to outline the process:

> The date slip is pasted opposite the pocket at the back of
> the book. The date which indicates when the book is due to
> be returned or when issued is stamped on each of three
> records, the reader's card, the book card and the date
> slip. The borrower's number is copied opposite the date on
> the book card. The date on the date slip indicates at once
> the file in which the book card is to be found, and the
> [librarian] assistant is able to discharge the book and
> release the borrower immediately on the return of the
> volume (Flexner, 1927, pp. 78-79).

In essence,
charging books or works to patrons involved
a lot of paperwork, and
you can imagine that it might be prone to error.
However, the number of systems at the time and
the discussions and debates around them show
that the processes and routines were steadily
becoming standardized, and
standardization is a necessary pre-requisite to automation.

Parker's achievement in automation eventually
improved the library experience for patrons
as well as the librarians at the circulation desk, and
indirectly their colleagues throughout the library.
That is, once circulation standards stabilized,
and once technology like punched cards
became available generally,
then it became possible to automate this
process for the library.
And this was good;
the effects were that automation increased circulation
and that an automated circulation process
[Saved The Time Of The Reader][ranganathan],
*down to four seconds to be exact!*

This is all to say that standards and technology
go hand and hand and that the details matter
when thinking about standards.
How does this relationship work?
Standards enable multiple groups of competing
interests to form consensus around
how technologyshould work, and
when this happens,
multiple parties receive payoffs at the expense
of any single party acquiring a monopoly.
This is true for the design of screwdrivers,
the width of railroad tracks,
the temperature scale, and
certainly also for how information is managed and exchanged.
The internet and the web wouldn't exist or
definitely not exist as we know it if not for
the standardization of the Internet Protocol (IP),
the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP),
the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP),
and other internet and web related technologies
that enable the internet and the web to work
for so many users regardless of the operating system and
the hardware they use.

## Readings

Our first article this week by Harris (2006)
covers the basic reasons for the existence of
[NISO][niso]
(the *National Information Standards Organization*)
and the kinds of standards NISO is responsible
for maintaining and creating.
These standards are directly related to
libraries and fall under
[three broad categories][niso2]
related to **Information Creation &amp; Curation**,
**Information Discovery &amp; Interchange**, and
**Information Policy &amp; Analysis**.
There are standards that touch on bibliographic information,
indexing, abstracting, controlled vocabularies, and
many other library important issues.
If you have not before paid attention to NISO,
you might now start seeing more references to the
organization and the standards it publishes,
especially because the international
library community has worked closely with NISO
to develop standards for various aspects of library work.

Another historical note:
As Harris (2006) elaborates in the article,
NISO came into existence in the mid-1930s.
This was about the same time that Ralph Parker
began working on his punched card system.
Not long before this, in the late 1920s,
the first library science graduate program
launched at the University of Chicago, and
in the early 1930s,
the first research based journal started,
*The Library Quarterly*.
We often hear how long libraries have existed,
and it's true that there were quite a
few accomplishments before the 1930s, but
it is this time period
(for these and a number of other reasons)
that marks the modern era of libraries.

We also are not simply interested in
standardizing things like the forms used
to catalog and charge a book,
to create member records,
to draw up licenses for an electronic resources,
as we'll discuss later.
We are also interested in standardizing,
as Flexner (1927) would say,
"routines", processes, or workflows.
Thus, our additional readings are on TERMS,
or *Techniques for Electronic Resource Management*.
TERMS is not a true standard, but
more of a *de facto* or proposed standard that
helps outline the electronic resource management work flow.
It was developed in order for librarians
or others dealing with electronic resources to come
to a consensus on the processes of
electronic resource management.
Version 1 of TERMS is described by the TERMS authors
in an issue of [Library Technology Reports][terms1].
Although it has been replaced by a [newer version][terms2],
it still functions as a thorough introduction
to the ERM work flow and provides guidance and
suggestions on all aspects of
electronic resource management.
For example, in [chapter 7][chapter7] of the LTS report
on TERMS version 1,
the authors provide information
on the importance of working with providers or
vendors in case of cancellation of a resource.
They write:

> Do not burn any bridges! Many resources have
> postcancellation access, which means you need to keep up a
> working relationship with suppliers; this might also incur
> a platform access fee going forward, so this needs to be
> budgeted for in future years. Review the license to fully
> understand what your postcancellation rights to access may
> be. In addition, you may resubscribe to the resources in
> future years. Content is bought and sold by publishers and
> vendors. Therefore, you may end up back with your original
> vendor a year or two down the line!

Some of this material is repeated in version 2 of TERMS,
but version 2 was created in order to address changes and
to include more input from the community.
Version 2 also includes a slightly modified outline, and
[includes the following parts][termsV2]:

1. Investigating new content for purchase or addition
1. Acquiring new content
1. Implementation
1. Ongoing evaluation and access, and annual review
1. Cancellation and replacement review
1. Preservation

At the same link just provided,
they also write about this new version:

> In addition to the works mentioned or cited in the
> original TERMS report, much has been written in the past
> few years that can help the overwhelmed or incoming
> electronic resources librarian manage their daily
> workflow. In the end, however, most of the challenges
> facing the management of electronic resources is directly
> related to workflow management. How we manage these
> challenging or complex resources is more important than
> what we do, because how we do it informs how successful
> and how meaningful the work is, and how well it completes
> our goal of getting access to patrons who want to use
> these resources.

As such,
the outline and the content described
in these two versions of TERMS is very much centered
on the ERM work flow.
TERMS is a guide and framework for thinking
on the different aspects of the electronic resource
life-cycle within the library, and
it helps provide librarians with a set of questions and
points of investigation.
For example, let's consider Term item 1,
which is to investigate new content
for purchase or addition.
In a presentation by the
[Emery and Stone (2014)][emery2014],
they suggest that this involves the following steps,
partly paraphrased:

- outline what you want to achieve
- create a specification document
- assemble the right team
- review the market and literature and set up trial
- speak with suppliers and vendors
- make a decision (Emery and Stone, slide 12, 2014)

Emery and Stone (2014) provide other examples, and
the TERMS listed in this slide are from the first version.
TERM no. 6, PRESERVATION, was added in version 2, and
TERMS nos. 4 and 5 from version 1 were joined together.

## Exercise

This week you have a two part exercise:

### First

Visit the NISO website and search for documentation
on a standard, recommended practices, or technical reports
and post about it.
The differences between these publications follows:

**Technical reports:**

> NISO Technical Reports provide useful information about a
> particular topic, but do not make specific recommendations
> about practices to follow. They are thus "descriptive"
> rather than "prescriptive" in nature. Proposed standards
> that do not result in consensus may get published as
> technical reports.

**Recommended Practices:**

> NISO Recommended Practices are "best practices" or
> "guidelines" for methods, materials, or practices in order
> to give guidance to the user. These documents usually
> represent a leading edge, exceptional model, or proven
> industry practice. All elements of Recommended Practices
> are discretionary and may be used as stated or modified by
> the user to meet specific needs.

**Published and Approved NISO Standards:**

These are the final, approved definitions
that have been achieved by a consensus of the community.

See [https://www.niso.org/niso-io/2014/03/state-standards][state]
for the descriptions.

### Second

After reading about TERMS,
try to place these TERMS in additional
electronic resource management context.
Please draw from your experience
using the ILS and ERM software,
from the readings,
your personal work experience in a library,
if you have that, or
use your imagination.
Specifically, it would be interesting if
you could pick out aspects of systems
like Coral or Folio that appear
to facilitate standardized workflows.
