# The ERM Librarian

## Introduction

In this section, I:

- provide examples of electronic resources,
- frame the topic of this course, and
- discuss the readings.

## Examples

This semester we learn about electronic resources and about how to manage them.
We begin by outlining the kinds of things that are electronic resources.
[Karin Wikoff][wikoff2011] (2011) outlines the major categories, and these include:

- **databases**
  - **A&I databases** (abstracting and indexing)
  - **bibliographic databases** full text databases
  - **journal collections**
    - Project Muse
    - JSTOR
  - **specialized and hybrid databases**
    - chemical databases: e.g., [Pubchem][pubchem]
    - genetic databases: e.g.,  [GenBank][genbank]
    - stock databases: e.g., [Nasdaq][nasdaq]
  - **primary source databases**
    - original newspapers: e.g., [Chronicling America][caLOC] 
    - oral histories: e.g., [Louie B. Nunn Center for Oral History][nunn]
- **ejournals**
- **ebooks** (see note below)
- **linking technologies**:
  - [Z39.50][z39niso]
  - [OpenURL][openURLniso]
  - [Federated search, aka Metasearch][metaniso]


> Ebook technology is rather complicated and differentiated depending on the copyright status, the file type (PDF, ePUB, TXT, etc.), and the purpose or genre (textbook, fiction or non-fiction, etc.).
> In some cases, ebooks are software applications and not just plain or marked up text.
> They also vary by platform or the application used to interact with the text, each of which may offer different types of functionality.

Linking technologies allow users to query in one search system, like a discovery service.
The discovery service then extends their query to other systems without requiring the user to initiate searches in those other systems.
For example, a user begins a search in a library's discovery system, like UK Library's [InfoKat][infokat] (powered by Primo ([Breeding, 2006][breeding2006])).
InfoKat identifies multiple articles related to the query, even though those articles are located in other full text systems, like EBSCOHost, ProQuest, or JSTOR.

## Framing

The print era of libraries was difficult enough, but managing print and using print resources was comparably a more linear process.
Electronic resources have raised the stakes.
Civilizations have had 500 years to develop and solve print technology, yet we have had only about three plus decades of experience with digital technology.
We are a long way off from stability, and the challenges and frustrations ahead of us are not simply technical but also social and legal.

As you surmise from the outline at the top of this page, electronic resources compose a major part of any library: academic, public, school, or special.
The need to manage them with efficient work flows requires attending to many parts of a system.
We will discuss and learn about the complexity of these systems because these systems have had a major impact on librarianship.

## Our Readings: The nature of ERM librarianship

Our readings this week provide introductions to electronic resource librarianship and help frame this course.

### A Specialist and A Generalist

The first article by [Stachokas][stachokas2018] (2018) surveys the history of this specialist/generalist librarian role.
Stachokas (2018) finds that the electronic resource librarian has their feet planted in technical services and collection development.
This requires a holistic understanding of the electronic resource work flow and of how it is embedded in the scholarly and library ecosystem.
This division leads to different areas of specialization:
those who focus on "licensing, acquisitions, and collection development" (p. 15), on "metadata, discovery, management of [knowledge bases][kbniso], and on addressing technical problems" (p. 15).
This rings true to me.
In my own observations, I have noticed that job announcements have increasingly stressed one of the above areas and not both.

### The Technical Communicator as the "Bridge"

In the second article, [Hulseberg][hulseberg2016] (2016) uses the field of [technical communication (TC)][techcomm] to interpret the field of electronic resource librarianship.
Hulseberg (2016) takes the view that an electronic resource librarian is a technical communicator.
A technical communicator does not help patrons with their technical problems.
Rather, they document and report technical processes.

Hulseberg (2016) highlights four important themes about ERM:
the interesting themes to me are *Theme one: Metaphors of "bridge" and "translator"*, and *Theme Two: Collaborating in a web of relationships*.
When I was an undergraduate, I wanted a job that would connect people from different silos and help them communicate.
It turns out that, under Hulseberg's (2016) view, electronic resource librarianship does this work.
However, the other themes are just as important.
In particular, **Theme Four** on jurisdiction highlights a major disruptive act on librarianship.

As an example, consider that people, researchers and scholars included, use non-library provided resources to locate information.
Additionally, more works, scholarly and non-scholarly, are freely and publicly available on the web, e.g., as [open access (OA)][oa].
This [disintermediates][burns2013] the library from the search process as a result of people using non-library services, like Google or Google Scholar, to retrieve freely available works on the web.
What then becomes of the core jurisdiction of the librarian and of the electronic resource librarian in particular?
In concrete terms: a recent paper ([Klitzing, 2019][klitzing2019]) reported that researchers state they use Google Scholar 83% of the time and EBSCOhost 29% of the time to find relevant material.
That raises strategic and technical questions about the role of the librarian and the library in today's scholarly communication system.

### To License or Not To License

The third article, by [Zhu][zhu2016] (2016), places a different theoretical lens on what it means to be an electronic resource librarian.
Zhu (2016) posits that the licensing aspect of electronic resource management influences ER librarianship identity.
Zhu's (2016) insightful findings are due to the fact that we often license electronic resources rather than buy them.

The crux centers around copyright law.
This law provides librarians with an important legal justification for lending works: the [First Sale Doctrine][copyrightsearch].
Copyright law provides copyright owners with the right to distribute their work.
However, the First Sale Doctrine holds that if you buy a copy of a book, then you have a right to lend or sell your copy.
This doctrine is fundamental to librarianship but raises problems since librarians license and do not buy digital works (ebooks, etc).
That is, the First Sale Doctrine does not apply to licensed works.
That ALA has a guide on this issue ([ALA, 2022][alaFirstSale]).

Stachokas (2018), Hulseberg (2016), and Zhu (2016) present the historical and environmental forces that shaped the work of electronic resource librarians and their professional identities.
These authors discuss important themes that function as evidence of these identities.
In our discussions this week, we should focus on these themes and how to make sense of them.

## Conclusion

Electronic resource librarianship is a fascinating area of librarianship.
Digital technologies are woven into all parts of the modern library ecosystem.
These digital technologies bring with them a slew of technical, legal, and social challenges.
Therefore electronic resource librarians have to maintain a holistic, interconnected view of this ecosystem as these technologies develop.
They also have to specialize in key areas that require maintaining this ecosystem.

The course takes that holistic view and divides it into four parts for study.
In the first part, we study the nature of the work itself: what it means to be an electronic resource librarian.

In the second part, we learn about the technologies that an electronic resource librarian uses and the conditions that shape these technologies.
We learn about integrated library systems (ILS) and how these systems conform (or not) to standards, and how they foster or obstruct interoperability and access.

In the third part, we focus on processes and their contexts.
We study the electronic resource librarian's workflow, the economics and the markets of electronic resources, the licensing of these resources, and negotiating with vendors.

At the end, we focus on patrons and end users; that is, those we serve. 
Because electronic resources are digital, when we use them we leave behind traces of that usage.
This means we study how we measure usage and what those measurements can validly say.
Since usage leaves traces of personal information, we examine topics related to the security of these resources and the privacy of those who use them.
Electronic resources likewise means having to use websites and other e-resource interfaces, and hence we study how electronic resource librarians study user experience and conduct usability studies.

## Discussion Questions

As we start to address this, consider the following questions:

1. How do we manage all of this electronic stuff? Not only does it include complicated technology and has an impact on our patrons, but it involves all different sorts of librarians.
1. What exactly is an electronic resource librarian? This basic question critiques the representations of librarians in the media (movies, TV shows, books)
   and the interactions we've had with librarians in our lifetimes.
