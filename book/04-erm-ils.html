<p>In this section we dive deeper into electronic resource management systems (<strong>ERMS</strong>), integrated library systems (<strong>ILS</strong>), and library service platforms (<strong>LSP</strong>).
Specifically, we seek to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the <strong>ILS</strong> and <strong>LSP</strong>. We define <strong>integrated library systems</strong>
and <strong>library service platforms</strong> and highlight their roles in managing
physical and digital assets.</li>
<li>Examine the <strong>modular structure of ILS/LSP</strong>. We look at how these products
are structured into <strong>modules</strong> (acquisitions, circulation, cataloging, etc.)
to handle library tasks and processes.</li>
<li>Learn about the <strong>evolution of user interfaces</strong> of these systems. We will
discuss the transition from <strong>OPACs (online public access catalogs)</strong> to
modern <strong>discovery systems</strong>, and how these systems enhance search
capabilities and integrate external sources.</li>
<li>Introduce the role of <strong>ERMS (electronic resource management systems)</strong>. We
learn how ERMS assist in managing the digital assets and licenses of a
library.</li>
<li>Explore the <strong>interconnectedness of systems</strong>. We specifically explore the
relationship between ILS, LSP, and ERMS, and how they work together to manage
a library's collection and provide access to users.</li>
<li>Provide access to <strong>practical applications</strong> of these systems. We will use
real-life examples  of these systems to see how librarians use them. This
will provide insight into how the shift from print to digital resources has
influence library organization and workflows.</li>
<li>Discuss <strong>trends and future directions</strong>. We will briefly touch on trends
like the growing interest in <strong>open-source ERMS solutions</strong> and the impact of
cloud-based systems  on library management.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ils-the-integrated-library-system"><a class="header" href="#ils-the-integrated-library-system">ILS, the Integrated Library System</a></h2>
<p><strong>ILS</strong> is an acronym for an <strong>integrated library system</strong>.
We were introduced to the newer term <strong>library services platform (LSP)</strong> in the previous section.
Although similar in ways (<a href="https://journals.ala.org/index.php/ltr/issue/view/509">Breeding, 2015</a>; <a href="https://librarytechnology.org/document/25609">Breeding, 2020</a>),
the latter are becoming more common because of how they handle electronic resources.
The main distinction is that the LSP is more focused on digital and electronic resources, and
the ILS is primarily an extension of the card catalog system model.</p>
<p>Regardless, both the ILS and the LSP are
"used by librarians to manage their internal work and external services," such as
"acquiring and describing collection resources, making those resources available to their
users through appropriate channels, and other areas of their [resource management] operations"
(<a href="https://librarytechnology.org/document/25609">Breeding, 2020, para. 1</a>).
We begin by discussing the modular structure of these systems.</p>
<h3 id="the-modular-administration-of-digital-and-electronic-resources"><a class="header" href="#the-modular-administration-of-digital-and-electronic-resources">The Modular Administration of Digital and Electronic Resources</a></h3>
<p><strong>ILS</strong>/<strong>LSP</strong> products are used for multiple tasks, and these tasks are divided up into <strong>modules</strong>.
These modules are accessed in the ILS/LSP through an administrative interface.
Some of the common modules among these products include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/reorg/3.2/acquisitions/">acquisitions</a> module</li>
<li>authority files module</li>
<li><a href="http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/reorg/3.2/cataloging/">cataloging</a> module</li>
<li><a href="http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/reorg/3.2/circulation/">circulation</a> module</li>
<li>course reserves module</li>
<li><a href="http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/reorg/3.2/opac/">online catalogs</a> module</li>
<li>patron management module</li>
<li>reports module</li>
<li><a href="http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/reorg/3.2/serials/">serials</a> module</li>
</ul>
<p>In the above list, I've linked to the open source documentation from <a href="http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/">Evergreen</a>, which is an <strong>ILS</strong>.
LibLime's <a href="https://liblime.com/bibliovation/">Bibliovation</a> product offers comparably named modules for
discovery, circulation, cataloging, serials, acquisitions, and systems administration.
LibLime is a LSP.
Other ILS/LSP solutions offer specific modules dedicated to other items in the list,
or those functions might be integrated into one of the above modules.</p>
<p>New modules appear in LSPs that take advantage of LSP abilities and digital assets.
For example, the <a href="https://exlibrisgroup.com/products/alma-library-services-platform/">Alma LSP</a> provides modules dedicated to acquisitions, resources, discovery (via Primo), fulfillment, administration, and
analytics.
Such modules are a reflection of the LSP's focus on digital and electronic assets.
Please take a moment and read about these modules in links provided.
Specifically visit the Alma and LibLime links to learn more about their specific LSP products.</p>
<h3 id="user-interface"><a class="header" href="#user-interface">User Interface</a></h3>
<p>Each of you are familiar with an ILS/LSP from a user perspective.
Some of you are familiar with these systems from a librarian perspective.
In your lifetimes, you have used <strong>OPACs</strong> (online public access catalogs) or <strong>discovery systems</strong> like <a href="https://saalck-uky.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?vid=01SAA_UKY:UKY&amp;lang=en">InfoKat</a>.
You have likely conducted a search for a <strong>serial</strong> (e.g., journal), and you have most definitely borrowed a book from a library.
The ILS OPAC or the LSP discovery systems makes these end user functions possible.</p>
<p>Until recently, the OPAC was the primary way to locate and access items in library collections.
However, in LSPs the OPAC has evolved into a <strong>discovery system</strong>.
This difference is based on what and how it searches its records and other factors.
The <em>Encyclopedia of Knowledge Organization</em> describes the differences as such:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>OPACs replicated and extended the functionality of the card catalogues they
largely replaced in providing a finding aid to the books, journals,
audiovisual material and other holdings of a particular library. The term
<em>discovery system</em> has come into use in the early Twenty-first century to
describe public-facing electronic catalogues which use the technology of the
Internet search engines to expand the scope of the OPAC to include not only
library-held content, including entries for journal articles and book
chapters that were not typically part of traditional library catalogues, but
also material held elsewhere which may be of interest to clients <a href="https://www.isko.org/cyclo/opac">(Wells, 2021)</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, OPACS generally searched against pre-defined fields recorded in <strong>MARC</strong> (i.e., author, title, subject, etc.).
These collections include print works but later electronic ones too held by the library.
The form didn't matter as long as there was a MARC record for it.
A discovery system can search additional text, if available.
It can more easily link to items not in the library collection but which can be acquired through <strong>interlibrary loan</strong>.</p>
<p>A discovery system can also integrate with <strong>bibliographic databases</strong> and return results indexed by those databases.
This saves the user from having to know about specific <strong>topical databases</strong>.
For example, UK Libraries provides access to nearly 750 databases, and having a discovery system that can access those is beneficial.
However, this does not mean that a discovery system is aware of all of a library's collections or all of its databases.
And it's not always clear what's left out.</p>
<p>In summary, some key differences for the user are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OPACs</strong> primarily search cataloged fields in <strong>MARC</strong> records.</li>
<li><strong>Discovery systems</strong> integrate external sources (like database) into the search
process and are able to do some <strong>full text</strong> searching.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="in-totality"><a class="header" href="#in-totality">In Totality</a></h3>
<p>From their ancient beginnings, these ILS/LSPs, as Stephen Salmon stated in 1975,
are "non-traditional" ways of doing traditional things,
such as "acquisitions, cataloging, and circulation," but which has now become fairly routine!</p>
<p>Electronic resource librarians might work extensively with specific resources or modules
in order to administer the library's digital assets (e.g., contracts, etc.).
However, all librarians use one or more of the ILS/LSP modules at some point.
For example, when I worked in reference at a small academic library,
I used the Millennium ILS to check out books to users, to fix borrowing issues, and to search for works in the OPAC.
Later I primarily used the cataloging module when I moved to technical services.
What a librarian uses frequently depends on the organizational structure of a library and their role in that library.
As our reading by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/01462679.2014.901200">Miller, Sharp, and Jones (2014)</a> show,
the rise in electronic resources has influenced the ways librarians structure their organizations.
Much of those organizational structure were originally informed by the dictates of a "print-based world".</p>
<p>In summary, the administrative interface includes modules to manage collections, patron accounts, etc.
The end user interfaces are for people looking for information.
Combined they make up the totality of the ILS/LSP software.
In short:</p>
<ul>
<li>an <strong>administrative interface</strong> is used by librarians to manage tasks
provided through modules.</li>
<li>a <strong>public interface</strong>, such as an OPAC or discovery system, is used by
librarians and patrons to access the library's collections.</li>
</ul>
<p>While ILS/LSP solutions are essential for managing physical and digital collections,
ERM systems play a pivotal role in managing the library's digital resources and
their associated licenses.</p>
<h2 id="erms-the-electronic-resource-management-system"><a class="header" href="#erms-the-electronic-resource-management-system">ERMS, the Electronic Resource Management System</a></h2>
<p>ERMS is an acronym for <em>electronic resource management system</em>.
Its function is born from the need to manage a library's <strong>digital assets</strong>, for example, the licenses that a library has signed.
In order to manage assets like licenses, the ERMS can keep track of the signatories,
the terms of the license/contracts, specific documents related to these processes, and more.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Licenses will be discussed in a later section, but they deal with the terms
of access, embargo periods, multi-user access limits, length of access,
retention and archival of content, and more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An ERMS may or may not be integrated with a library's ILS software.
But it's more likely integrated in a LSP solution.
The Alma LSP, for example, is a LSP that also provides <a href="https://knowledge.exlibrisgroup.com/Alma/Product_Documentation/010Alma_Online_Help_(English)/Electronic_Resource_Management">electronic resource management</a>.
In short, a library that uses an ILS may be using a separate ERMS product.
However, a library that uses an LSP may be using the LSP for electronic resource management.</p>
<p>Like the ILS/LSP, ERM software is generally divided into modules.
These modules focus the librarian's work on particular duties to create workflows and knowledge management systems.
In an ERM like the open source <a href="http://coral-erm.org/modules/">CORAL system</a>, the modules include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://coral-erm.org/resources/">Resources</a>: a module "provides a robust database for
tracking data related to your organization's resources ..." and "provides a
customizable workflow tool that can be used to track, assign, and complete
workflow tasks."</li>
<li><a href="http://coral-erm.org/licensing/">Licensing</a>: a module for a "flexible document management
system" that provides options to manage licensing agreements and to automate
parts of the process.</li>
<li><a href="http://coral-erm.org/organizations/">Organizations</a>: this module acts as a type of advanced
directory to manage the organizations that impact or are involved in
the management of electronic resources, including "publishers, vendors,
consortia, and more."</li>
<li><a href="http://coral-erm.org/usage-statistics/">Usage Statistics</a>: a module providing librarians with
usage statistics of digital assets by platform and by publisher. Supports
COUNTER and SUSHI. We'll cover COUNTER and SUSHI later in the semester, but
as a preamble:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.projectcounter.org/about/counter-for-libraries/">COUNTER</a> "sets and maintains the standard known as the Code of
Practice and ensures that publishers and vendors submit annually to a
rigorous independent audit", and,</li>
<li><a href="https://www.niso.org/standards-committees/sushi">SUSHI</a> is a type of protocol to automate collecting data on usage
statistics.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://coral-erm.org/management/">Management</a>: this module provides a document management
system aimed at "storing documents, such as policies, processes, and
procedures, related to the overall management of electronic resources".</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="readings"><a class="header" href="#readings">Readings</a></h2>
<p>In our readings this week, we have three articles that speak to ILS/LSP and ERM software solutions and the relationship between the two.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/14955">Fournie (2020)</a> notes, the electronic resource market is consolidating into a few heavyweights.
Yet this trend does not have to force libraries into solutions that lead to vendor lock-in or acceptance of <em>walled gardens</em>.
As such, there has been a growing interest in open-source alternatives, especially among libraries seeking more customizable solutions.
In the process, Fournie (2020) describes two ERM solutions: Coral and Folio.
The author's descriptions are helpful in understanding what these two software solutions are capable of providing.</p>
<p>The readings by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/01462679.2014.901200">Miller, Sharp, and Jones (2014)</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/0361526X.2020.1717032">Bahnmaier, Sherfey, and Hatfield (2020)</a>
provides context about how these technologies impact librarianship.
Miller et al. (2014) describe a case study that shows how electronic resources have impacted organizational structure, job titles, budgets, and more.
Likewise Bahnmaier et al. (2020) discuss aspects of this and reflect on changes in library staffing and how this raises the importance of the library-vendor relationship.</p>

<p>We will see what services and modules they provide, and how they function.
Be sure to visit the links in this page, especially any documentation.
I'll ask that you log into the relevant services, test the demos sites, or watch the demo videos.
This will help get some hands-on experience with them and also demystify what each do.</p>

<h2 id="addendum"><a class="header" href="#addendum">Addendum</a></h2>
<p>In prior semesters, we read articles by <a href="https://doi.org/10.6017/ital.v31i3.1914">Wang and Dawes (2012)</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00987913.2011.10765404">Wilson (2011)</a>.
I replaced those readings back in the Fall 2022 semester, but for those interested, I briefly describe them below.</p>
<hr />
<p>In the article by Wang and Dawes (2012), the authors describe the "next generation integrated library system",
which should meet the criteria that include the ability to merge ILS software with ERM software.
ERM software solutions exist because integrated library systems (ILS) failed to include functions to manage digital assets.
Basically, the ILS was still behaving with a print-mindset, so to speak, and was growing stagnant.
Around the time the article was published, more ILS and ERM software began moving to the cloud, as was common in other software markets.
This changed the game because it placed a burden on software companies to maintain their software.
Based on demand and need, the LSP was created as a next-generation ILS that included ERM functionality.
So it's likely that even though the LSP might replace the ILS/ERM combo someday,
it could be that we'll live in a dual world where some libraries use a LSP and some use the LSP/ERM combo.
Currently, this is often reflected in library types:
academic libraries are moving more towards LSPs while public and other libraries use ILSs and other solutions to manage their electronic resources.</p>
<p>Despite the technical aspects of these solutions, at its basic, both ILS/LSP and ERM software solutions focus on managing assets
(books, serials, <a href="https://archives.yale.edu/subjects/33488">realia</a>, etc) so that librarians can organize and users and librarians can retrieve those assets.
There's no requirement to use any solution offered by a library vendor, and that's the point of the Wilson (2011) article,
which shows how regular software can be used to function as a homegrown solution for creating and implementing an ERM work flow.</p>
