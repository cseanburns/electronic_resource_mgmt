<h2 id="introduction"><a class="header" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Collection development and acquisitions
is a complex problem for
electronic resources.
To rehash, in the print-only days,
acquiring resources was a
<em>more-than-it-is-now</em> linear process.
Librarians became aware of an item,
sought reviews of the item,
possibly collected the item,
described it, and then shelved it.
And maybe, depending on the
type of the library,
weeded it from the collection
at some future date 
during their regular
course of collection assessment.</p>
<p>The above is a simplistic take, but
there are additional vectors
to be aware of with electronic resources.
First, as we have learned,
libraries may or, more likely,
may not own digital works,
and different subscription services
require different kinds of contracts.
Second, electronic resources
(ebooks, journal articles, databases, etc.)
require different handling and disseminating
procedures due to differences in
technologies and licenses.
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/19411260903466269">Martin et al. (2009)</a>
pinpoint the issue
when they write that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As much as we would like to think our primary concerns
about collecting are based on content, not <strong>format</strong>
[emphasis added], e-resources have certainly challenged
many long-established notions of how we buy, collect,
preserve, and provide access to information (p. 217).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="collection-development"><a class="header" href="#collection-development">Collection Development</a></h2>
<p>Although a world where the
format dictates so much makes
an intriguing world,
it can be problematic and worrisome.
We think that content should be king and
that &quot;collection managers should focus
on the content of the information provided,
regardless of the actual form in which the
information arrives&quot;
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0099-1333(94)90043-4">(Harloe &amp; Budd, 1994, p. 83)</a>.
We have already learned that some
<a href="09-markets-economics.html">formats cost more</a>,
but we must also ask,
how does format (or <em>form</em>) either prevent
or facilitate access?
If you catch the implicit gotcha there,
you can see that a thread
connects acquisitions,
collections development, and usability,
the latter which we'll learn more
about later in this work.</p>
<p>In a collection development course,
you would unquestionably focus on
content and on the work that
is involved creating a
collection development policy (CDP),
which I hope you do or
spearhead if your library does not have one.
Content and CDPs are relevant
to the acquisition, collection, and
management of e-resources.
However, in a major way,
it is also important to understand
how the management of electronic resources
have impacted librarian work flows and
how that has shaped, or re-<strong>formed</strong>,
library organizational hierarchy.</p>
<h3 id="organizational-hierarchy"><a class="header" href="#organizational-hierarchy">Organizational Hierarchy</a></h3>
<p>A quick note about the organizational hierarchy.
Such hierarchies are often graphically
presented in organizational charts.
I developed an organizational chart
based on my readings of librarian
departmental reports written during
the late 1950s and early 1960s
by librarians at the University of Kentucky, and thus,
well before electronic resources took over.
These departmental reports are
archived at the University of Kentucky's
<a href="http://libraries.uky.edu/SC">Special Collections Research Center</a>.
Organizational charts have been
around since the 1800s, but
I am not sure when libraries started to
create and use them, and
I didn't see one in my research
on UK Libraries for this time period.
Thus, I inferred an organizational structure
based on the detailed reports written
by the various department heads in the
library at the time (<em>See Fig. 1</em>).
When you compare my chart based on the past
to the most <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190722033735/https://libraries.uky.edu/forms/OrgChart.pdf">recent one provided by UK Libraries</a>
(see aside below),
it's clear that additional complexities
have been added.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/1950s60sorgchartUKlibraries.png"

title="Organizational chart UK Libraries late 50s / early 60s">
<figcaption>
Fig. 1. This is a derived organizational chart based on
annual reports of University of Kentucky
departmental head librarians. Research is based on reports
held at the UK Library's Special Collections Research
Center. 
</figcaption>
</figure>
<blockquote>
<p>Aside: The most recent organizational chart for UK
Libraries is from 2019. Much has changed since then,
including a new Dean, but the general idea should hold
about the complexity of the modern library.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This complexity is very interesting.
The growth in electronic resources,
associated technologies, and markets
do not explain all of it:
knowledge has become more specialized, and
library organizational structure reflects that;
student populations have grown
considerably since then,
in size and heterogeneity, and
library structure will reflect that; and
the theory and praxis of library management
has evolved throughout the decades, and
library structure will reflect that.
Other issues are at play, and
it is certainly true that
they are all interconnected.
However, I do think that
technology and e-resources
account for a large portion of
the increasing complexity
that we see here in the difference
between these two organizational charts
at different times of the Library's history.</p>
<p>But again, consider the influence of format.
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1108/CB-04-2015-0006">Lamothe (2015)</a> finds
that if electronic e-reference sources
are collected and perpetually updated,
then they get continually used.
If it's a static e-resource,
then usage declines.
I hope additional studies pursue
this line of questioning
because it raises questions about the
expectations that patrons have about content;
perhaps something about how <em>fresh</em>
they expect that content should be.
It also suggests that a resource
like Wikipedia has an advantage,
since many articles on Wikipedia
are regularly updated (although not all),
and that might lead to a perception
of Wikipedia as <em>fresh</em>,
relative to what is in a library's
collection.</p>
<h2 id="open-educational-resources"><a class="header" href="#open-educational-resources">Open Educational Resources</a></h2>
<p>Let's switch topics to discuss
Open Educational Resources (OER),
which is a hot topic these days.
Textbook prices,
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/1941126X.2017.1304767">England et al. (2017)</a> notes,
have skyrocketed in recent decades.
It's suggested that college students budget
<a href="https://research.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/trends-in-college-pricing-student-aid-2022.pdf">up to $1,240 per year in books and supplies</a>,
and <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/741558/us-public-school-textbook-expenditure/">public elementary and secondary schools</a>
expend nearly 2.5 billion
dollars per year on textbooks.
In response, libraries have
notably moved to highlight
open educational resources at some level.
For example,
UK Libraries provides resources about
<a href="https://www.uky.edu/copyright/facultyresources/openeducationalresources">Open Educational Resources</a> and
provide a LibGuide on <a href="https://libguides.uky.edu/c.php?g=222941&amp;p=6722485">OER</a>.</p>
<p>Sites such as <a href="https://www.oercommons.org/">oercommons.org</a>,
<a href="https://openstax.org/">openstax</a>, <a href="https://libretexts.org/">LibreTexts</a>,
and others function as digital
libraries of open access educational resources.
The idea is to eliminate these
exhorbitant costs,
which put great burdens on taxpayers,
families, and students who pay for them,
by providing high quality,
open access textbooks and other
educational resources.</p>
<p>Most of these resources are,
I believe,
pushed to faculty to replace
proprietary textbooks.
However, it's useful to ask 
whether libraries ought to collect
and acquire these resources,
which would involve promoting
OER at a whole other level.
For example, librarians could
catalog OER items and
add records for them in their
catalogs or discovery systems
(see <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0961000611435253">Hill &amp; Bossaller, 2012</a>
for a comparable discussion).
Or should libraries not be involved at all?
This seems like a
<em>duh</em> kind of question, but libraries,
public or academic,
have not traditionally collected textbooks.
So, should they?
Would this change their fundamental mission?
Would it change the game for them as
educational institutions?</p>
<h2 id="collection-development-policies-of-electronic-resources"><a class="header" href="#collection-development-policies-of-electronic-resources">Collection Development Policies of Electronic Resources</a></h2>
<p>Finally, I'd be guilty of a
serious wrongdoing if I did
not discuss the importance of having
a collection development policy (CDP) and
using that policy to guide the collection,
acquisition, and assessment
of electronic resources.
I want to emphasize the
importance of a CDP for e-resources.
Unfortunately, not all libraries,
even at major institutions,
create or use a CDP.
If you end up working at such a library,
I highly encourage you to
convince your colleagues of its importance.
A CDP should define a collection, and
then include most if not
all the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>mission, vision, and values statement</li>
<li>purpose of CDP statement (scope may be included here)</li>
<li>selection criteria: this could be general but it could
also include subsections that focus on specific
populations, genres, resource types, and more</li>
<li>assessment and maintenance criteria</li>
<li>challenged materials criteria (esp important at public,
K-12 libraries)</li>
<li>weeding and/or replacement criteria</li>
</ul>
<p>It can be helpful to see how
libraries treat electronic resources
in those that have policies that
include them.
The following two CDP policies,
one from the
<a href="https://library.louisiana.edu/about-us/policies-procedures/e-resources-serials-management">University of Louisiana (UL)</a> and
one from the
<a href="https://www.lexpublib.org/collection-development-policy">Lexington Public Library (LPL)</a>.
do contain sections on electronic resources.
The UL CDP is not their
main policy but a sub-CDP that
focuses on electronic resources.
The LPL's policy is their main policy.
Although it does not include a
long discussion of electronic resources,
electronic resources are mentioned.
Neither approach is wrong because each
are catered to the specific libraries and their
purposes, communities, and vision statements.</p>

of electronic resources,
how the format of electronic resources
influences workflows,
how electronic resources influences
organizational hierarchies,
how the movement to make educational
resources open has extended to
libraries, and
