<h2 id="introduction"><a class="header" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>What is user experience? <a href="https://doi.org/10.4018/978-1-5225-2255-3.ch661">Dickson-Deane and Chen (2018)</a> write that
"user experience determines the quality of an interaction being used by an actor in order to achieve a specific outcome" (Intro section, para 1).
<a href="https://doi.org/10.4135/9781483386874.n229">Parush (2017)</a> highlights adjacent terms like <em>human-computer interaction (HCI)</em> and <em>usability</em>.
Let's say then that HCI encompasses the entire domain of interaction between people and computers and
how that interaction is designed and that <em>user experience (UX)</em> focuses on the quality of that interaction.
These are not precise definitions, and some people might use the terms <em>UX</em> and <em>HCI</em> interchangeably.
However, as ERM librarians, the job is to focus on the quality of the patron's experience with electronic services.
This entails understanding both the systems and technologies involved and the users interacting with them.</p>
<p>Dickson-Deane and Chen (2018) outline the parameters involved with UX.
Let me modify their example and frame it within the context of an ERM experience for a patron:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Actor</strong>: A user of the web resource, like a library website.</li>
<li><strong>Object</strong>: The web resource, or some part of it.</li>
<li><strong>Context</strong>: The setting.
<ul>
<li>What's happening?</li>
<li>What's the motivation for use?</li>
<li>What's the background knowledge?</li>
<li>What's the action?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>User Interface</strong>: The tools available by the object and the look and feel.
<ul>
<li>More specifically, Parush (2017) states that "the user interface mediates between the user and computer" and it includes three basic components:
<ul>
<li><em>controls</em>: The tools used to control and interact with the system: buttons, menus, voice commands, keyboards, etc.</li>
<li><em>displays</em>: The information presented to the user or the hardware used to present the information: screens, speakers, etc.</li>
<li><em>interactions and dialogues</em>: The exchange between the system and the user including the use of the controls and responding to feedback.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Interaction</strong>: What the actor is doing with the UI</li>
<li><strong>(Intended/Expected/Prior) User experience</strong>: The intended or expected use of the object. The user's expectations based on prior use.</li>
<li><strong>(Actual) User experience</strong>: The actions that took place; the actions that had to be modified based on unintended results.</li>
</ul>
<p>These parameters would be helpful for devising a UX study that involves observing patrons interacting with
a system and then interviewing them to complete the details.
Note that the same kind of systematic thinking can be applied to evaluate other user experiences,
like those between a librarian and an electronic resource management system.
Often the focus is on patron user experience, but it's just as important to evaluate UX for librarians and
to consider UX when selecting an ERM system or an ILS/LSP system.</p>
<p>In any case, these parameters help us step through and highlight the complicated process of interacting with a computer, generally, or
a library resource more specifically.
As with other topics we've discussed in this book, we can incorporate these parameters into a workflow for evaluating UX.</p>
<h2 id="complex-library-websites"><a class="header" href="#complex-library-websites">Complex Library Websites</a></h2>
<p>It is as a result of the complexities involved and because of a focus on systems that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00987913.2015.1069527">Pennington (2015)</a>
argues for a more UX centered approach to library website design.
Think about your own state of knowledge of ERM before you started learning about this area of librarianship.
For example, now that you know somewhat how link resolvers function,
your experience using them and your understanding of their technical aspects provides you with a set of skills and experiences
that make you more likely to identify the cause of a malfunction if you find one.
With this ability to identify problems, problems becomes easier to solve, and the experience itself involves less anxiety.
However, most users and patrons of these systems will not have any technical knowledge of these systems.
Thus, when these systems break on them, their frustration with the experience might lead to unfortunate outcomes:
they may not retrieve the information they need; they may not reach out to a librarian for help; or
they may stop using the library's resources in preference for a resource of inferior quality.
We need to remember that this happens, and if possible, to build in <em>proactive troubleshooting</em> processes
that anticipate and solve them before they do happen to patrons.</p>
<p>Here's the crux, though.
As you gain more skill and expertise with these systems, you will eventually lose the ability to see these systems as a novice user, and
that distance will only grow over time.
To mitigate this, it is essential to actively gather data from a diverse range of users (Pennington, 2015).
For example, gathering data from different user demographics, such as students versus faculty, users with disabilities, or children versus teens,
can reveal varying UX challenges that are often overlooked by experienced librarians.
UX research that includes diverse patron feedback ensures that the needs of all user groups are taken into account.
In short, user experience research nurtures a user centered mindset.</p>
<p>Indeed, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acalib.2022.102541">Kraft et al. (2022)</a> used focus groups and surveys to collect user experience data on a library's
implementation of its A-Z Database List.
As the authors point out, librarians have long made efforts to reduce the use of library terminology in their messaging to patrons
since this only serves as a point of confusion.
However, their focus group participants described contrasting opinions about how color was used on the site, and
how color was used had some dramatic, surprising effects on which sources were selected to pursue.
The study highlights that when gathering user feedback, it is important to consider a variety of user research methods to get a fuller picture.
We can even add additional methods, such as <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/card-sorting-definition/">card sorting</a>
(for understanding how users group and label information) and
<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/thinking-aloud-the-1-usability-tool/">think-aloud protocols</a>
(where users verbalize their thoughts while using a system).
These methods provide additional insights that can complement focus groups and surveys.
All methods have their strengths and weaknesses, but selecting the appropriate approach based on research goals is key to effective UX evaluation.</p>
<h2 id="the-data-that-exists"><a class="header" href="#the-data-that-exists">The Data That Exists</a></h2>
<p>In addition to user studies that require conducting direct research and reading prior studies that require literature searches,
we should also know that libraries already possess a wealth of data to explore, and this data could provide needed insight.
Here, as we've learned before, workflows play an important role in applying mechanisms to track, report, and fix problems with
electronic resource systems.
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/1941126X.2015.999521">Browning (2015)</a>, for example, describes the use of <a href="https://www.bugzilla.org/">Bugzilla</a>.
This is an application that's commonly used for software development for bug tracking and generating reports about broken code.
Once problems are identified, tools like Bugzilla can be used to categorize and to facilitate quick solutions.
It's an interesting and novel adaptation of an application designed for a different purpose, but it highlights an important takeaway;
there are thus two key types of data that provide insights into UX: data about usage and data about breakage.
Whereas usage data helps us understand how users interact with a system and what they do (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00987913.2016.1140614">Fry, 2016</a>),
breakage data focuses on identifying errors or issues that users encounter, as described by Browning (2015).
Both kinds of data are crucial and combining both perspectives offers a more comprehensive understanding of user experience.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a class="header" href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>I agree with <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00987913.2016.1140614">McDonald (2016)</a> that despite having around 30 or so years of experience
with web-based and other electronic resource types, we are still in the throes of disruption.
There's much yet to learn about designing for the web, just like there's a lot left to learn about how designing physical spaces.
Nothing will be settled for a while.
Although I doubt if there will be any single dominate user experience or user interface, since there are many
cultures, backgrounds, and aesthetics, I'm sure the low-hanging fruit problems will work out soon enough.
Remember though that 95% of the cause of all of this complexity is due to copyright issues,
which necessitate the entire electronic resource ecosystem and the complications that are introduced by working with vendors who work with different,
but overlapping, publishers, etc.
If something major were to change about copyright, then it's a whole new ballgame.</p>
<p>But in conclusion, when considering how UX research fits into library work, remember the importance of gathering data from users themselves:
data that reveals both what works well and what doesn't.
In conducting UX work, refer also to the information-seeking literature when it's appropriate to do so.
This literature will yield insights into the processes people use to use these systems.
It's essential to reflect on user-centered design principles, such as <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/chunking/">chunking</a>, <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/visual-hierarchy-ux-definition/">highlighting</a>,
<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/simplicity-vs-choice/">simplifying choices</a>, and <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/complex-application-design-framework/">managing complexity</a>.
These are strategies that can help design user interfaces that are intuitive and accessible for all users.</p>
