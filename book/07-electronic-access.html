<p><strong>Access</strong> is the paramount
principle of librarianship, and
all other issues,
from censorship to
information retrieval or
to usability,
are on some level derived from or framed
by that principle of <strong>Access</strong>.</p>
<p>This week we devote ourselves
to a discussion of <strong>electronic access</strong>.
To start, let's begin with
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00987913.2014.929483">Samples and Healy (2014)</a>,
who provide a nice framework
for thinking about
managing electronic access.
They include two broad categories,
<em>proactive troubleshooting</em> and
<em>reactive troubleshooting</em> of access.</p>
<ul>
<li>proactive troubleshooting of access: &quot;defined as troubleshooting access
problems before they are identified by a patron&quot;. Some examples include:
<ul>
<li>&quot;letting public-facing library staff know about planned database
downtime&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;doing a complete inventory to make sure that every database paid for is
in fact 'turned on'</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>reactive troubleshoot of access: &quot;defined as troubleshooting access issues as
problems are identified and reported by a patron&quot;. Some examples include:
<ul>
<li>&quot;fixing broken links&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;fixing incorrect coverage date ranges in the catalog&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;patron education about accessing full text&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal here, as suggested by
Samples and Healy (2014),
is to maximize
proactive troubleshooting and
to minimize reactive troubleshooting.
The Samples and Healy (2014)
report is a great example
of systematic study.
The authors identify a problem that
had grown &quot;organically,&quot;
collected and analyzed data, and
then generalized from it by outlining
a &quot;detailed workflow&quot;
to &quot;improve the timeliness and
accuracy of electronic resource work.&quot;
Practically, studies like
this promise to improve
productivity and work flows
and foster job and
patron satisfaction.
Such studies also help
librarians identify the kinds of
software solutions that align
with their own
workflows and patron
information behaviors.
If interested,
I suggest reading
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/1941126X.2021.1949162">Lowe et al., 2021</a>
about the impact of Covid-19
on electronic resource management.
Six authors individually
describe access issues
at their respective institutions and
show how issues of
pricing, acquisitions, training,
user expectations, and
budgets affect electronic access.
I suggest reading articles
like this in light of the
framework provided
by Samples and Healy (2014)
because stories like these,
about this impact of the
pandemic on electronic access,
can help guide us in
developing proactive troubleshooting
procedures minimize
future issues,
pandemic or otherwise,
at our own institutions.</p>
<p>Samples and Healy (2014)
say something important against a common
assumption about electronic resources,
particularly those provided by vendors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The impression that once a resource is acquired, it is then just 'accessible'
belies the actual, shifting nature of electronic resources, where continual
changes in URLs, domain names, or incompatible metadata causes articles and
ebooks to be available one day, but not the next (<em>The Complexity of ERM</em>
section, para. 6).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence, unlike a printed work
from the long ago print-only era that,
once cataloged,
may be shelved for decades or longer
without major problems of access,
electronic resources require
constant and active attention
to maintain accessibility to them.
Ebooks, for example,
can create metadata problems.
For example,
often what's important
about scholarly ebooks,
in particular,
are the chapters they include, and
hence metadata describing
ebook components is important,
along with providing links to
those chapters in discovery systems.
This difference between
item-level cataloging and
title-level cataloging,
as Samples and Healy describe,
can lead to confusing and problematic
results when considering
different genres
and what those genres contain.</p>
<p>Or, note that they discuss how
a series of links are involved
starting from the source of discovery,
e.g., an OPAC or a discovery layer,
to the retrieved item, and
how difficult it might be in
determining which of these links and
which of those services
is broken when
access becomes problematic.</p>
<p>Let me highlight a few key findings from their report:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Workflows</strong>: why does this keep coming up? It's because workflows help
automate a process---simplify and smooth out what needs to be done, and
because this is only possible when things are standardized.</li>
<li><strong>Staffing</strong>: we'll discuss this more in another section, but part of the
problem here is that ERM has had a major impact on organizational structure,
but one where different libraries have responded differently. This lack of
organizational standardization has its benefits regarding overall management
practices and cultures, but it also has huge drawbacks---and that's the
difficulty in establishing effective, generalized workflows that include key
participants, and to minimize as many dependencies on any one person.</li>
<li><strong>Tracking</strong>: if there's no tracking, there's no method to systematically
identify patterns in problems. And if that's not possible, then there's no
method to solve those problems proactively. It becomes all reactive
troubleshooting, and reactive troubleshooting, as Samples and Healy indicate,
results in poor patron experiences. We'll discuss tracking when we during the
week on Evaluation and Statistics.</li>
</ul>
<p>We commonly get the line
that discovery systems are a
great solution
to all the disparate
resources that
librarians subscribe to.
Or, if we do think about
problems with such systems,
we are often presented with a
basic information retrieval problem,
such that the larger the collection to search,
the more likely a relevant
item will get lost in the mix.
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/1941126X.2017.1270096">Carter and Traill (2017)</a>
point out that these discovery systems
also tend to reveal
access problems as they are used.
The authors provide a checklist
to help track issues and improve
existing workflows.</p>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.5860/lrts.60n1.23">Buhler and Cataldo (2016)</a>
provide an important reminder
that the mission of the
electronic resource librarian
is to serve the patron.
This should remind us that the
internet and the web
have flattened genres.
By that I mean they
have made it difficult
to distinguish among works 
like magazine articles, news articles,
journal articles, encyclopedia articles,
ebooks, etc.
Though the Buhler and Cataldo (2016)
reading is student-focused,
other studies have hinted
at the same issue they describe
across other populations.
It's important,
if possible,
to recognize these issues as
ERM librarians and
work to resolve them
in the ways that you
would be able to.</p>
<p>Myself, I grew up learning about
the differences between
encyclopedia articles, journal articles,
magazine articles, newspaper articles,
book chapters, handbooks,
indexes, and dictionaries
because I grew up with
the print versions,
which by definition,
were tangible things
that looked different from each other.
Today, a traditional first year
college student was born
around the year 2004 and
grew up reading sometime
in the last decade.
The problem this raises is that
although electronic resources
are electronic or digital,
they are still based on genres
that originated in the print age,
yet they lack the
physical characteristics that
distinguished one from the other.
E.g., what's the difference
between a longer
<em>NY Times</em> article
(traditionally a newspaper article) and
an article in the <em>New Yorker</em>
(traditionally a magazine article) today
in their online forms?
Aside from some aesthetic differences
between the two,
they are both presented on web pages,
and it's not altogether obvious,
based on any kind of cursory examination,
that we can tell,
as regular users,
that they're entirely different genres.
However, there are important
informational differences between the two,
how they were written,
how they were edited,
how long they are,
and who they were written by
that might still lead us to
consider them as different genres.
Even <em>Wikipedia</em> articles pose this problem.
Citing an encyclopedia article was
never an accepted practice,
but this was only true
for general encyclopedias.
It was generally okay
to cite articles from
special encyclopedias because
they focused on limited subject matters
like art, music, science, culture, and
were usually more in-depth in their coverage.
Examples include the
<em>Encyclopedia of GIS</em>,
the <em>Encyclopedia of Evolution</em>,
<em>The Kentucky African American Encyclopedia</em>,
<em>The Encyclopedia of Virtual Art Carving Toraja--Indonesia</em>,
and so forth.
There are studies that show that
<em>Wikipedia</em> provides the same
kind of in-depth coverage
of some special encyclopedias,
thus helping
to flatten the encyclopedia genre, too.</p>
<p>The flattening holds
true for things like <em>Google</em>.
The best print analogy for <em>Google</em>
is that of an index,
which was used to locate
keywords that would
<em>refer</em> to source material.
The main difference
between these indexes and <em>Google</em>
is that the indexes were
produced to cover specific publications,
like a newspaper,
or specific areas,
like the <em>Social Science Citation Index</em> or
the <em>Science Citation Index</em>,
both of which are
actual, documented, historical precursors
to <em>Google</em> and to <em>Google Scholar</em>.
But today, these search engines
are erroneously considered source material
(e.g, &quot;I found it on Google&quot;).
Few, I think, would have considered
a print index as source material,
but rather as a <strong>reference</strong> item,
since it <em>referred</em> users to sources.
Nowadays, it's all mixed up,
but who can blame anyone.</p>
<p><strong>Example print indexes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/6wqu02M7OQzyJnCG2">Photos of the New York Times Index</a></li>
<li><a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/JpnqxzZ44dhM06cq2">Photos of the Newspaper Index for the Washington Post</a></li>
<li><a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/Y5ronALog63zIxwr1">Photos of the Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="access-and-authentication"><a class="header" href="#access-and-authentication">Access and Authentication</a></h2>
<p>Let's spend some a bit of time
on the technologies around
and access and authentication.
Much of what exists in a
library's electronic collections is paywalled,
therefore librarians use software
that authenticates users before
they acquire access.
This is generally required
in agreements with content vendors.</p>
<p>There are two main technologies
used to authenticate users.
The first is through an IP / proxy server.
Here, <a href="https://www.oclc.org/en/ezproxy.html">EZproxy</a> (OCLC)
is the main 
product in this arena, and
in fact we use EZproxy at UK.
When we access any paywalled work,
like a journal article,
you may notice
the <strong>ezproxy.uky.edu</strong>
string of text in a URL.
For example,
the following is an EZProxy URL:</p>
<pre><code>https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy.uky.edu/science/article/pii/S030645730500004X
</code></pre>
<p>The interesting thing about
this URL is that it has a
<strong>uky.edu</strong> address even
though the article is in
a journal that's
hosted in Elsevier's
<em>ScienceDirect</em> database.
The <strong>www-sciencedirect-com</strong>
part of the address is
a simple subdomain of
<strong>ezproxy.uky.edu</strong>
(you can tell because
the components are separated
by dashes instead of periods),
As a subdomain,
it is no different than
the <strong>www</strong> in <strong>www.google.com</strong> or
the <strong>maps</strong> in <strong>maps.google.com</strong>.
The original URL is
in fact:</p>
<pre><code>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030645730500004X
</code></pre>
<p>As opposed to the first URL,
the interesting thing about
the original URL is that it
is in fact a 
<strong>sciencedirect.com</strong> address.
Even though &quot;sciencedirect&quot;
appears in the <strong>uky.edu</strong> URL,
it is not a &quot;sciencedirect.com&quot; server.
They are two different servers,
from two different organizations,
and are as different as
<strong>uky.edu</strong> and <strong>google.com</strong>.</p>
<p>The reason we read an article
or some other paywalled content
at a <strong>uky.edu</strong> address and not
at a, e.g.,
<strong>sciencedirect.com</strong> address
is because of the way
proxy servers work.
In essence,
when we make a request for
a resource,
like a journal article or
a bibliographic database,
that's provided by a library,
our browser makes the request
to the proxy server and not
to the original server.
The proxy server then
makes the resource request
to the original server,
which relays that content
back to the proxy server (EZproxy),
which then sends 
the content to our browser.
This means that when we request
an article in a journal
at sciencedirect.com or jstor.com,
our browser never actually makes
a connection to those servers.
Instead, the proxy server
acts as a go-between.
See <a href="https://libtechlaunchpad.com/2017/04/25/proxy-servers-basics-and-resources/">Day (2017)</a>
for a more technical
and yet accessible
description of the process.</p>
<p>Proxy servers provide access
either through a login server
or based on the user's IP address.
If we're on campus,
then our authentication is
IP based,
since all devices attached
to the university's network
are assigned an IP
from a pre-defined
range of IP addresses.
This makes access to paywalled
content fairly seamless,
when on campus.</p>
<p>If we are off-campus,
access is authenticated
via a login method to
the proxy server.
When we attempt to access
paywalled content from off-campus,
we will see an EZproxy login URL.
This looks something like this
for accessing the
<em>ScienceDirect</em> database:</p>
<pre><code>http://ezproxy.uky.edu/login?url=https://www.sciencedirect.com
</code></pre>
<p>Aside from <em>ScienceDirect</em>,
you can see a list of other
subscribed content that requires
EZproxy authentication here:</p>
<pre><code>https://login.ezproxy.uky.edu/menu
</code></pre>
<p>The second main technology
used to authenticate and
provide access
is based on what is
called SAML authentication.
The main product that provides
SAML authentication for libraries is
<a href="https://www.openathens.net/">OpenAthens</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike a proxy / IP
authentication process,
SAML is a type of identity
verification system.
Under this method,
libraries offer a single sign-on
process, and
once authenticated,
patrons have access to
all SAML ready
content or service providers.
The process is similar to
the <a href="https://duo.com/docs/sso-generic">Duo Single Sign-On</a>
service our university
uses for authentication.
In the OpenAthens case,
users are authenticated via
an identity provider,
which would be the library
or the broader institution
(and usually via some
other software service).
The library provides identification
by connecting to its organization's
identity management system,
such as <em>adfs</em>, or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Directory_Federation_Services">Active Directory Federation Services</a>.
Once a patron has been authenticated,
a confirmation is sent to the
content provider, which
then provides access to
the content to the patron.
For more details,
see <a href="https://www.onelogin.com/learn/saml">What is SAML?</a> and
this detailed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o4syOJsIf0">OpenAthens software demo</a>.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of this method
is that URLs are not proxied,
which means that content is not
delivered to the patron
from a proxy server like  EZproxy.
Instead, patrons access the
original source directly.
From a patron's perspective,
this makes sharing URLs nicer.
As far as I can tell,
one of the downsides might
be privacy related.
With a proxy server,
users don't access the
original source, but
instead the source is delivered
through the proxy server,
which by definition,
masks the patron's IP address
and browser information.
This wouldn't be true under
the SAML method.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a class="header" href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>The Samples &amp; Healy (2014) and
the Carter &amp; Traill (2017) articles
address troubleshooting strategies 
with electronic resources.
One additional thing to note
about these readings is
how the organizational structure
influences workflows and how
the continued transition from
a print-era model of library processes
to an electronic one remains problematic.
Even once that transition is complete,
both readings make the case that
strategy and preparation are
needed to deal with these issues.
The Buhler &amp; Cataldo (2016) article
shows how confusing e-resources
are to patrons and
how the move to digital has
complicated all genres,
or &quot;containers&quot;, as
the authors name them.
Such &quot;ambiguity&quot; has
implications not only for
how users find and identify
electronic resources but
on how librarians manage
access to them.</p>
<p>I added the
EZproxy and OpenAthens
content in order to complete
the technical discussions we
have had in recent weeks on
integrated library systems, 
electronic resource management systems,
link resolvers,
and standards.
These authentication and access
technologies complete these discussions,
which, altogether,
cover the major technologies
that electronic resource librarians
work with to provide access
to paywalled content in library
collections.
Both technologies aim to
provide seamless access to
paywalled content, as
nearly as seamless as accessing
content via a search engine or
other source.
Although neither will never be
able to offer completely seamless
access as long there are paywalled
sources in library collections,
the job of an electronic resource
librarian is often to make sure
they work as well as possible.
This will often mean working 
with vendors and colleagues.</p>
