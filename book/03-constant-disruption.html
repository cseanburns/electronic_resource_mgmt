<p>I think we might conclude at this point that there are many
different ways to frame the role of the
electronic resource librarian.
In <a href="01-the-erm-librarian.html">The ERM Librarian chapter</a>,
Stachokas (2018) showed how the
electronic resource librarian works across technical
services and collection development and
how this requires a holistic view as well as a specialized
understanding of the various processes involved.
Huleberg (2016) illustrated how framing
electronic resource librarianship as a technical
communicator yields important insights into the work
and profession.
Zhu (2016) used the licensing aspect of electronic resource
management work to show how central this activity
is to the field's identity.</p>
<p>In the
<a href="02-desperately-seeking-erm-librarian.html">Desperately Seeking an ERM Librarian</a>
section,
we reviewed a list of qualifications from current job
advertisements for electronic resource librarian positions.
In Murdock (2010),
we learned how these kinds of qualifications are tied
to various technological developments.
As the technology changes, and it changes a lot
(see <strong>aside</strong> below),
so do the qualifications.
One of the big takeaways from Harnett's (2014) article,
for me at least,
is that conceptual knowledge of the relevant technology
is more important than practical knowledge,
although the two are not always so easily divorced
from each other.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Aside: See The Library Technology Guides' page on
<a href="https://librarytechnology.org/mergers/"><em>The History of Mergers and Acquisitions</em></a>
<em>in the Library Technology Industry</em> to get a sense of
how much change has taken place in the last 40+ years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Based on the readings so far,
I think it's safe to say that the work of
electronic resource librarianship is one of
constant disruption.
And by that I mean,
it might be more difficult to find a thread of continuity,
from its early days to now,
in this role than it would be in other areas of
librarianship.
That might be part of what makes this area so interesting,
but it does present some challenges.</p>
<h2 id="framing"><a class="header" href="#framing">Framing</a></h2>
<p>The first listed reading we have this week is by
Marshall Breeding.
Astute observers will note Breeding is one of the
first cited authors in the two additional readings
we have this week.
We will read more from Breeding later, but
I bring him up now because he oversees a website titled
<a href="https://librarytechnology.org/">Library Technology Guides</a>.
If you would like to keep abreast of the recent news
on the electronic resource industry,
Breeding's website should be at the top of your list.</p>
<p>Breeding's <em>What is ERM?</em> article is a good one
to start the week.
He provides an outline of the various components of
electronic resources, and
he provides some historical context for those components.</p>
<h3 id="the-focus-on-academic-libraries-is-misleading"><a class="header" href="#the-focus-on-academic-libraries-is-misleading">The Focus on Academic Libraries is Misleading</a></h3>
<p>One caveat, though:
while all the articles on our list this week are focused on
academic libraries,
the terms, concepts, and processes described
in these articles are relevant to other areas of
librarianship such as public librarianship,
school media librarianship, and so forth.
Differences in processes and in some details will
arise due to organizational or other contextual differences
among these library types.
Organizationally, for example, public libraries are
connected to municipalities, county governments,
state libraries, and to public library consortia.
This presents unique organizational challenges, and
it highlights the fact that municipal, county, or state laws
will define how some processes must be handled and
who must handle them.
The same is true for public schools, and in such cases,
school boards and school districts will likely be involved
(see <strong>aside</strong> below).
Contextual differences that shape electronic resource
management include user communities.
An academic library serves its students, faculty, staff, and
perhaps the public to some degree.
However, a public library serves its local community.
Such differences will shape ERM workflows and other choices,
like the chosen vendors and publishers.
For example, academic libraries provide more scholarly
sources, and public libraries provide more ebooks and
audiobooks and less e-journals.
This means that you might find services like
OverDrive/Libby, Epic, and Hoopla
offered by public libraries but not in academic ones, and
that you will rarely find more advanced scholarly resources
in public libraries.
These differences in needs, due to different communities,
will change the emphasis on some aspects
of the ERM work flow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Aside: As an example, see the impact that the current
book bans are having on ebook providers and note all
the parties involved in these situations, including:
superintendents, county officials, county school system,
school district employees, etc.
<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/library-apps-book-ban-schools-conservative-parents-rcna26103">NBC News</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another reason why our reading lists
lean toward the academic setting is not because
electronic resource management is not relevant to public
or other types of libraries, but it is because
academic librarians publish more about
electronic resources and public librarians publish very little.
For example, I conducted a search in <a href="https://libguides.uky.edu/803">LISTA</a>
with the following query,
which returned just three results in 2021 when I first ran
the query and four results in August 2022 when I ran it again.
In fact, a new article wasn't published since the 2021
query. Rather, LISTA just added an addition item from 2015.</p>
<pre><code>(DE &quot;ELECTRONIC information resources management&quot;)  AND  (DE &quot;PUBLIC libraries&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>It does not get much better if I expand the query
to include some additional thesauri terms.
This query returns only six results in 2021 and seven in
2022:</p>
<pre><code>(DE &quot;PUBLIC librarians&quot; OR DE &quot;PUBLIC librarianship&quot; OR DE &quot;PUBLIC libraries&quot;) AND  (DE &quot;ELECTRONIC resource librarians&quot; OR  DE &quot;ELECTRONIC information resources management&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>However, if I focus that query on academic libraries,
then the results increase substantially.
The following query returns 51 hits in 2021 and 57 in 2022:</p>
<pre><code>(DE &quot;ELECTRONIC information resources management&quot;)  AND  (DE &quot;ACADEMIC libraries&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>And this query returns 82 results in 2021 and 90 in 2022:</p>
<pre><code>(DE &quot;ACADEMIC librarians&quot; OR DE &quot;ACADEMIC librarianship&quot; OR DE &quot;ACADEMIC libraries&quot;) AND  (DE &quot;ELECTRONIC resource librarians&quot; OR  DE &quot;ELECTRONIC information resources management&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>We could continue to explore <strong>LISTA</strong> or other databases
for relevant material on ERM and public libraries, and
we would find more.
For example, more results are retrieved when I attach 
terms like <strong>e-resources</strong>, <strong>integrated library systems</strong>,
<strong>discovery platforms</strong>, or <strong>ebooks</strong> to a public library
search in LISTA.
But the results are nearly always much less than
academic library searches.
Another example, my local library system,
<a href="https://lexpublib.org/">Lexington Public Library</a>,
uses the <a href="https://librarytechnology.org/product/carlx/">CARL</a> integrated library system,
but there doesn't appear to be any articles in LISTA
about it since 2015.</p>
<p>Anyway, you get the picture.
There simply isn't a lot of material on
electronic resource management from the
public library perspective, and
a quick search in the school media sphere
mirrors this issue, too.
The following search return zero results in 2021 and in 2022:</p>
<pre><code>(DE &quot;LIBRARY media specialists&quot;)  AND  (DE &quot;ELECTRONIC information resources management&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>If you go into public librarianship or
school media librarianship,
I'd encourage you to publish on electronic resources.
It would greatly benefit your peers and those of us
who teach courses like this.</p>
<p>Back to Breeding.
I understand some terms Breeding uses and the technologies
he describes might still be new to us.
Let me spend some time providing some additional
background information and highlighting some things
to look for in these three articles.</p>
<p>Librarians started to migrate to
electronic resource management in the 1970s.
Breeding mentions this.
This is when it happened en masse, but the seeds were
planted well before this.
I published <a href="https://doi.org/10.1353/pla.2013.0051">a paper</a> a few years ago that
provides a historical account of the first library
automation project,
which took place in the 1930s with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card">Hollerith punched cards</a>.
By the 1960s,
the primary use of computers was to manage circulation, and
in the late 60s and early 70s,
library automation focused on managing patron records.
In the early 1970s, tools became available to manage and
search bibliographic records.
Hence, computers were first used mostly to manage the
circulation of books,
then patron records,
which allowed patrons to check out works <em>electronically</em>,
and then we had the ability to search for works.
If a work of interest was located using these tools,
the work could be retrieved from the shelves or ordered
via interlibrary loan by snail mail.
Full text search came much later with the introduction
of better storage media, like CD-ROMs, and
saw major growth with the introduction of the internet to
more institutions in the 1980s
and the web in the early 1990s,
which at its heart is nothing more than a big
document retrieval system.</p>
<p>In the process of migrating from print to electronic,
all sorts of things had to change, but
all that change rests on the major premise of librarianship:
<strong>to provide access by organizing information
in order to retrieve information</strong>.
Although you may have often heard that libraries
are ancient entities,
libraries and librarianship as we understand them today
did not modernize until the late 1800s but more
so starting in the 1920s and 1930s.
It was then that some in the profession began to hone in on
the major complexities and challenges,
social and technological,
involved in <strong>organizing</strong> and <strong>retrieving</strong> information
in order to provide <strong>access</strong>.
The challenges with organizing and retrieving information
that they identified nearly 100 years ago were indeed
major and problematic, but fortuitous,
because it gave rise to what we now called
<em>library science</em>,
the rigorous study of libraries, librarianship, collections,
users, communities, and so forth.</p>
<p>Yet consider when those people laid the groundwork
for a library science nearly 100 years ago,
librarians only managed print and the primary means of
accessing print collections was through a physical building.
With the introduction of computer systems in the 1960s and
with better networking technologies in the 1980s and 1990s,
issues with organizing and retrieving information grew
exponentially, and indeed,
this exponential increase created new complexities and launched
an entire new field, what we now call <em>information science</em>.</p>
<p>All right, back to the ground level.
Let me highlight some key terms in Breeding's article.
They include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding aids</li>
<li>Knowledge bases</li>
<li>OpenURL link resolvers</li>
<li>ERM systems</li>
<li>Library service platforms (LSP)</li>
<li>Integrated library systems (ILS)</li>
</ul>
<p>Unless you already have some solid experience
with these things, and even after reading Breeding's
article, these terms may still be abstract.
So, this week, you have two major tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find real, practical examples. Pick one or two of the
above terms and see how they work in practice. Then come
back here and tell us what you found. Use the articles to
help you locate actual products or examples.</li>
<li>Locate how these terms appear in either the Cote and
Ostergaard (2017) article or the Fu and Carmen (2015).
Note other terms that may appear in those two articles
and comment on the role they play in the ERM work flow
and the migration process.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="work-flow"><a class="header" href="#work-flow">Work flow</a></h3>
<p>As you work on this task,
I ask that you pay attention to the emphasis on work flow.
The idea of a <strong>work flow</strong> is a major theme in this course
because it is a major part of
electronic resource management.
We'll come back to the idea over and over this semester.
Also, as we read the Cote and Ostergaard (2017) and
the Fu and Carmen (2015) article,
we will learn about how migrating to new systems is a
major, expensive, and time-consuming project, and
one of the great things about
these two articles is that it documents the work flows
used in these migrations.
If you become involved some day in a migration process,
you should use articles like these to assist you and
to help you make evidence-based decisions about what
you need to accomplish.
And like what these authors have done,
I'd encourage you to document and publish what you learned.
In the print era,
there were some cases where librarians had
to migrate to new systems, too.
For example, some research libraries in the U.S.
started by classifying collections using the
Dewey Decimal Classification system, but
then began to convert to the
Library of Congress Classification system after
the mid-20th century.
This was no small task.
Today, migration is big business in the library world
(see Breeding's site for other examples)
because the technology changes fast and
because there are a number of competing electronic resource
management products that librarians can choose
for their communities,
which they might be inclined to do if the migration
provides an advantage to their users, communities,
and themselves.</p>
